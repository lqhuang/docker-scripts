# jira-software and confluence

Atlassian jira software and confluence

## Tips

If confluence and jira share one database instance, they have to set different `schema` to avoid conflict.
But confluence isn't able to configure `schema` during installation process.
One solution is to insulate their data into two different databases.
Hence, an extra init script for `PostgreSQL` to create two databases is required.
